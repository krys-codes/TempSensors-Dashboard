# TempSensors-Dashboard
 Simple responsive dashboard which allows you to check all the temperatures in your home - created using Blebox's api ([here](https://technical.blebox.eu/openapi_tempsensor/openAPI_tempSensor_20210118.html)) and Blebox's tempSensor devices.
 
**Small thing before assigning the address:**
 >TempSensor can change its address if the power has been turned off so make sure you've assigned ip address per mac.
 
 >Each device has dhcp turned on automatically and you can't set the address manually in its configuration.
 
 
 
 
## Usage:
 
 Add your temperature sensor ip address and assign the name [here](/config/ipList.json).
